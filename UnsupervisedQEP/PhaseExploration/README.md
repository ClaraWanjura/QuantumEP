Here, we show phase exploration in a cluster Ising chain of length 10 described by the Hamiltonian
$` H = g_X \sum_j X_j + g_{ZZ} \sum_j Z_j Z_{j+1} + g_{ZXZ} \sum_j Z_{j-1} X_j Z_{j+1} `$
by optimizing $` \langle X_1 X_4 \rangle `$. 

Required packages: numpy, scipy (sparse matrices), matplotlib (plotting).
