# Cluster Ising model phase recognition via QEP: Revised Manuscript version with soft coupling cutoff

The notebook in this folder produces all the figures regarding cluster Ising model phase recognition
in the revised manuscript, both main text and supplementary material. The only exception is the
analysis of gradient vs shot noise and nudge strength, which is unchanged, and for which the figures
can be found in the upper-level folder (SupervisedQEP) in the QEP notebook.
