# Code for the supervised learning part

Training to recognize quantum phases of a quantum many-body system, 
by coupling a quantum sensor with tuneable parameters and learning those parameters using QEP.

- Original manuscript (arXiv version): QEP_notebook.ipynb and ProductionRuns
- Revised manuscript, with a soft cutoff for the sensor-system couplings: Go inside SoftCouplingCutoff folder.

As you will see, the notebook QEP_notebook.ipynb (or the module qep.py inside the production run folders) contains general functionalities for constructing a spin/qubit Hamiltonian using sparse matrices, for QEP training, and for the specific example of the cluster Ising Hamiltonian and phase recognition.
