This folder contains the code and results for the phase sensor coupled to a Kitaev honeycomb lattice of 8x2 spins.

All relevant code is contained in 'Kitaev_phase_sensor.ipynb'. This Jupyter notebook uses 'qep.py' which has to be in the same directory.
Example results and the data reported in the publication are collected in the folders 'SensorTrainingHistory' and 'TrainedSensorPerformance'.
