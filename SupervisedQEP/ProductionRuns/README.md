# Production runs

These subdirectories contain the code for production runs 
that were used in creating the figure on supervised learning in the manuscript.

The main code base (i.e. the qep module) may slightly differ between these runs,
when functionalities were added later.

Results were collected from the outputs produced (on a cluster) and inserted into the
notebook provided here for the final plotting.
